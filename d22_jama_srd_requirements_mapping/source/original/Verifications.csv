PRD SRD 1029 TFS 653 - Reports - Need better error message for 'no data' when running empty Audit Report



The test exercises the ""Audit"" reporting in the case when no changes have been made to the system.

This specifically hits the case in the TFS where there is no data for the report,

but also verifies the closely related case where the audit report should have data to report on a fresh/clean/unchanged system (initial conditions).



Pre-requisites:

1. Ensure that no database is existed

2. Install a fresh GrowthDirect

   When entering names (Methods, Action/Alert, Handling Rules, Worklist) system shall provide improved error message. Note: On implementation is was found the issue was embedded spaces character so removing those character solved issue instead of change message  


  


 +=====================


   TFS 1433  


   Summarized as:  


     Place focus in any Name field and type in an alpha character the user is presented this error message    


              1. A space character is not an invalid value, the systems should not warn the user that it is an invalid character.    


     2. The error message goes away when another alpha character follows the space. Not sure why we need the error message?    


      3. If two consecutive space characters are entered in followed by an alpha character the error message is not removed leaving the users guessing what they did wrong.     


  


  


 +===================


 Test Plan:


 The change as described is improved error messages when entering names. Specifically cited in the TFS is the case when typing in a Name, if a space character is entered the user immediately sees ""Invalid Value"".  If the intent is to create a Name with a space in the middle which is valid  (e.g. ""foo bar"") this is distracting/confusing.


 Additionally there is followup about double-blanks, preceding blanks, and suffix blanks.


  


 The change improves error messaging when entering names.


 User can type any valid characters, blanks at prefix and suffix are trimmed, and double-blanks that are inside are coalesced into a single blank.  A check is then made against existing Names.


  


 Note the SRD and TFS do not talk about upgrading from earlier versions, CSV import, or detecting/handling invalid/unsupported characters.


  


 The test is to type in a variety of Names with embedded, preceding, suffix blanks, user doesn't get error messages, confirm trims work, and confirm check of existing Names works.

2. Delete current GrowthDirect and Archive Database

3. unplug network cable from your simulator machine so system will not send out notification email for this simulator

4. Restore Unit33's database

5. Launch GrowthDirect, open user role, modify operator (add more role for example) and save it

6. Go to IT, select 365, click Archive button wait for the archive process to complete

7. Launch SQL, you will see that an inactive record of userrole (operator)

Note: qualified userrole (or inactive) means inactive (table has o for this specific) user role which has been updated and become old record ( show 0 in Database not 1)

 Pre-requisites: 



 Important Note for knowledge:  


 
	 o Modified Print Worklists page to remove the Lot/Batch ID/Range length limit of 12 characters. 
	 o Modified the Order Tests page to remove the Lot/Batch IDs length limit of 12 characters. 
	 o Modified the Samples page to change the Sample ID length limit from 32 to 50 characters. 
	 o This solution will be like the LIMS barcode label where the actual cassette record ID is embedded into the label. Note this solution only work for label printed by GrowthDirect system, however customer printed ""Sample ID"" barcode label shall still have same 32/12 character limits. 
 

 

 Test Scenarios: 

New unlimited SampleID/Lot label

Note 1: The actual label may not contain entire ""Sample ID"" or ""LOT"" however contains embedded cassette ID contain that information

Note 2: Ok to have no ""Sample ID"" and ""LOT"" assuming cassette ID is valid


 
	 o Example 1: ""$SSample1^LotX^12345678"" 
	 o Example 2: ""$^^12345678"" 
	 o Example 3: ""$SSample1^LotX^12345678 :S5"" -- This is a Matrix that in IOQ and IMZ Barcode setting to be turn on . This must be tested with Example1 and 2 (after Example 1 and 2 thoroughly tested) 
 

 

 Configuration with network barcode printer:  


 Note: Method: 30 mins   Image interval: 5 minutes (default back 240 after the test)


 
	 Ensure network Barcode label printer is used 
	 Verify EOS1 printer on network is powered on and connected 
	 GD2 System, go to “General Setting” 
	 Confirm “Bridge Computer” ON. If it is not, click it to turn on. 
	  Set the following items on “barcode Printer” section

 SRD 1069

System shall consider gripper (IOQ/IMP) part-present sensor value only if gripper is closed. This change prevent IOQ movement resulting from system attempting to identify a cassette after tripping part-present sensor.


  


 TFS 3695

Manufacturing pointed out their concerns regarding IOQ movement after tripping IOQ Part Present sensor.

The decision was made (Rich, Ed, Bruce) that we would allow the Gripper open state to override the  Part Present sensor.

The change was applied to both the IOQ & IMZ gripper


  


 Reproducing the issue:


 To reproduce - using GDSystem 2.3.1.15  - open the IOQ door, insert key to allow system to be in normal Running mode with IOQ door open.  Using caution and expecting IOQ Z-robot arm movement, use a piece of paper to cover the IR sensor on the IOQ gripper.  If the IOQ is in the lower position it will move upward.  If IOQ robot arm already is in the upper position the QR code reader will flash.


 Test Procedure:


 Using GDSystem 2.3.3.9 or later - perform above procedure.  Observe no IOQ Z-robot arm movement or QR code reader flashing.

,,,,Verification,GDP-Verfication-1674,QRT-298 Overview GrowthDirect interaction with trap defect repair camera,"Andor cameras could come with trap defect, which will cause the vertical dark column. The trap defect is a short circuit that drains the photon electrons and during the readout causes the intensity of following consecutive pixels to also drain and appears as vertical dark column starting at the defect. The dark column may or may not run to the bottom of the image, will be lower in intensity than left/right neighbors, and is affected by the intensity of the image at that point. The trap defect column is a potential risk of FP/FN. To prevent that risk, the trap column should be fixed before vision software processing.    


    The current implementation requires a Trap Defects file that specifies the location of each defect for that sensor.   


  


    To repair the defect column, the pixel intensity along the trap column is replaced by the mean value of two horizontal neighboring pixels.

    Overview:   


    The tests focus on GDP-PREQ-??? Cluster-Synchronization of Methods, Action Alerts, Handling Rules, Samples and Worklists.   


         


   

  


      COMMON TESTS FOR M/AA/HR/S      

    The following are ""COMMON TESTS"" reused when testing Methods, Action-Alerts, Handling rules, Samples.   Replace the [ITEMS] reference with the relevant section title.   


    Test 1 – Confirm [ITEMS] are propagated across the cluster.   


 
	    Create [ITEMS] that use all fields (refer to section “REPORTS” for specific instructions).  Confirm they are propagated to other Instruments.     
 

    Test 2 – Max Length Name (50) / Description (1000)   


 
	    Create [ITEMS] that use maximum length name and description.  Confirm they can be successfully propagated.    
 

    Test 3 - Confirm the following sequences result in propagation:   


 
	    New, Save (this is achieved in Test 1 above)    
	    Edit, Save    
	    Delete    
	    New, Cancel (not propagated)    
	    Edit, Cancel (not propagated)    
 

    Test 4 – Max Cardinality   


 
	    Add 20 [ITEMS].  Confirm the scrollbar show up. Confirm they are successfully propagated and displayed on local and remote UIs.    
 

    Test 5 – Content – arbitrary content for description and name fields.    


    Test 5b – Blank description

,,,,Verification,GDP-Verfication-1792,Overview,"Overview:  


 From TFS 3826: Remove feature which allows for unlimited Sample ID/ Batch IDs via DB lookup by CID in label.


 ES: Remove option from being set (comment out), default (force) it disabled.


 As a result of support for Clusters, the change that was made in 2.3.3.x builds to support unlimited Sample ID/Batch IDs by using the CID in the label to ultimately look up the Sample ID/ Batch ID in the DB is not beneficial and has been decided in a meeting with Eric, Kelly, Bruce, and Erika that it should be permanently disabled and removed from the UI.


 Removing this feature will prevent incompatibilities with fielded systems and ensure that any system clustered or not will have the same sample ID /Batch ID. 


 This removes SRD 1011 see TFS-3708


  


  


  


  Configuration with network barcode printer:  


 Note: Method: 30 mins   Image interval: 5 minutes (set it back 240 after the test is done)


 
	 Ensure network Barcode label printer is used 
	 Verify EOS1 printer on network is powered on and connected 
	 On menu Options screen, click  “General Setting” button, confirm “Bridge Computer” ON. If it is not, click it to turn on. 
	 On Menu Options screen, click Printer Setttings button, click Barcode tab, add a Network Barcode for Example: Type: Network. Printer IP : 10.0.0.X    Label : any selections are OK, click “Save” button
