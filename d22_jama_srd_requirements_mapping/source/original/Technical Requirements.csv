 1. Identify the test user for the corporate side test

2. On corporate side of Bridge configure 2 shares

    a. Read/Write to the test user in step 1

    b. Read Only to the test user in step 1

3. In the Read Only share from step 2 (add the file using a user other than the user from step 1)

 In general setting enable the bridge computer and Save the setting. If the error ""Failed to connect to the Bridge Computer. Please check the network cable and confirm if the Bridge computer is started."" is shown double check the wiring of the bridge computer to the Growth Direct. See WI0118.

2. Use simulator and Unit 33's database

3. Delete current GrowthDirect and Archive Database

4.  Unplug network cable from your simulator machine so system will not send out notification email for this simulator. 

5. Restore Unit33's database

6. Launch GrowthDirect, open user role, modify operator (add more role for example) and save it


 7. Remove the System Email Recipient from the IT Setting on the Growth Direct and save it.


 8. Restore the network cable unplugged in step 4."
